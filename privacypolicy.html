For example, we may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the Third-Party Access Sites and your preferences:

In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, personal information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to our sponsors or us.

How We Collect Information About You
When you access our application, we collect and store certain profile information that you provide directly or through the Third-Party Access Sites.
